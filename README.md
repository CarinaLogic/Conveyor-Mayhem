# RPG
An open-source side-scroller action rpg. Made using libGDX.
## Note
This is a personal project made by a CS student with little java experiences. 
Do not expect me to make a high-quality code.
Also, I will never make it pay-to-win / put adverts for profit.
My goal is to make an enjoyable game while getting touch with java, and nothing more.

This project is licenced under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
If you are one of those corporation that take open-source projects, infest it with ads & microtransactions, and publicize it without credit / without releasing the source code, FUCK YOU.

## Why did I make this?
Somewhat extreme personal thoughts below, be careful.

Games are made for dumb people to do dumb things. This will...
* Enable wider audience
* Make it easy for content creators to make funny content (because we are programmed to laugh at such things ever since comedian was a thing)
* Give people "I can do better!" vibes (enables competition), leading more sales (which is also why "Only 1% can complete this" ad is working)

Evil corporations are limiting smart decisions. Such as...
* Limiting the time spent on decisions
* Making some contents inaccessible without paying
* Hides some mechanics (damage formula, enemy behaviour patterns etc...)
* Making RNG (random number generator) play a huge role in the game
* Overcomplicates the game, to the point where it's not possible for human brain to come up with best decisions
* Oversimplifies the game, to the point where everyone can come up with best decisions, so that other factors (mainly microtransactions and RNG) can screw you over

They also made it easy for people to evaluate how good you are doing.
More damage = Better, Faster = Better, Higher stats = Better.
It's for players to compete with streamer/each other even if they are dumb (in reality corporations doesn't care who wins because they will profit anyway)

Basically, fuck that. I made & continue making this game with following in mind.
* No pay-to-win
* No hidden mechanics (hence open-source)
* Moderate amount of complexity
* Pause-able (even on multiplayer)
* One stat cannot represent how good you/your units are
