# RPG
An open-source action rpg with building element. Top-down 3d maps with 2d sprites. Made using libGDX.
## Note
This is a personal project made by a CS student with little java experiences. 
Do not expect me to make a high-quality code.
Also, I will never make it pay-to-win / put adverts for profit.
My goal is to make an enjoyable game while getting touch with java, and nothing more.

## Licence
This project is licenced under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
If you are one of those corporation that take open-source projects, infest it with ads & microtransactions, and publicize it without credit / without releasing the source code, FUCK YOU.

## Goals
Here's a list of things that I keep in mind while making this.
- Not making the action too fast, giving players enough time to make thoughtful decisions
- Low dependency on RNG
- Ease to predict what will happen (previews, no hidden mechanic)
- Minimal grinding
- Absolutely no pay-to-win
- Absolutely no ads
