# RPG
An open-source side-scroller action rpg. Made using libGDX.
## Note
This is a personal project made by a CS student with little java experiences. 
Do not expect me to make a high-quality code.
Also, I will never make it pay-to-win / put adverts for profit.
My goal is to make an enjoyable game while getting touch with java, and nothing more.
